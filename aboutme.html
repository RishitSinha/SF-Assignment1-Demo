        <h1>My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people dont know.</h1>
        <p>
            I have been beaten four times - three times by men and once by a woman.

            I have taken to living by my wits.

            I have a turn both for observation and for deduction.

            I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive.

            My mind rebels at stagnation.

            I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.

            My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
